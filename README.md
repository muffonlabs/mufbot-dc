## Tech stack
- Programming Language: Rust ðŸ¦€ (nightly)
- Framework: [Poise](https://github.com/serenity-rs/poise)

# Future goals

- **Extend mufbot from discord only to discord + github**, with seamless integration between both.
- **Synchronize issues between discord (forum posts) and github (issues).**
- **Play audio streams right into discord's voice channels by utilizing muffon's api.** Idea is not considered complete and development would require other chores to be completed first. ***Work may start from next year.*** This idea suggests that mufbot can be used in the future as a music bot for all discord servers.

# Setup
To setup the bot:
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file in the root of the repository and add the appropriate values.
3. Either use the prebuilt binary with the `./scripts/get_latest_mufbot.sh` script or build the bot yourself.
